# KroneckerPolynomials

Algorithms to check whether a polynomial is Kronecker or not. The implementation is carried out in GAP. You can find the following algorithms:

1. Sequential GCD method. Credits to Pieter Moree.
2. Sturm sequence based method. Credits to David Boyd.
3. Graeffe polynomial based method. See [1](#davenport), page 248.
